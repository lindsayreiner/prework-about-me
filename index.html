      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an INTJ, book lover, all-things-beauty enthusiast, and I'm working on a career change into Web Development. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Edison, NJ. Raised in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Brief stint in Seattle. Currently residing in Raleigh, NC.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Reading, writing, traveling and exploring new places, and learning new things.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Web Developer in a tech startup.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Raleigh, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My brain works in systems, and structure which I feel lends itself well to coding. Also, I like creating and seeing the outputs of code (something that looks foreign to most), and turning it into something that is aesthetically pleasing and easily digested by the masses.</p>
